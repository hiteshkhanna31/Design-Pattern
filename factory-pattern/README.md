# Factory Pattern - C++ Example

This project demonstrates the Factory Design Pattern in modern C++.  
It defines a `ShapeFactory` that creates different `Shape` objects (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) based on input.

## Key Features
- Abstract base class with pure virtual methods
- Dynamic memory with `std::unique_ptr`
- Simple pattern to extend with new shape types
